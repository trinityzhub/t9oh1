# Option 1

1. **Open Terminal**: First, open a terminal window.

2. **Update Package Database**: While you don't want to update the whole OS, it's a good practice to update the package database to ensure you have the latest information about available packages.

   `sudo dnf makecache`

3. **Install Timeshift**: Install Timeshift and its dependencies. You can use the `--setopt` flag to prevent automatic updates of other packages.

   `sudo dnf install timeshift --setopt=install_weak_deps=False`

4. **Verify Installation**: After the installation is complete, you can verify that Timeshift is installed correctly by running:

   `timeshift --version`

This command sequence should install Timeshift and its necessary dependencies without updating the entire operating system. If you encounter any issues or if additional dependencies are required, the terminal will provide error messages that you can use to troubleshoot further.

# Option 2 x86

To install Timeshift on a Fedora 40 live USB environment without updating the entire operating system, you can follow these steps. This process involves downloading the necessary packages and their dependencies manually.

1. **Open a Terminal:** First, open a terminal window on your Fedora 40 live USB environment.

2. **Install `dnf` Plugin for Downloading Packages:** You need the `dnf-plugins-core` package to use the `dnf download` command. Install it using:

   `sudo dnf install dnf-plugins-core -y`

3. **Download Timeshift and Its Dependencies:** Use the `dnf download` command to download Timeshift and its dependencies without installing them:

   `sudo dnf download timeshift`

4. **Install the Downloaded Packages:** Navigate to the directory where the packages were downloaded (usually `/var/cache/dnf` or a similar location) and install them using `dnf`:

   `cd /var/cache/dnf sudo dnf install *.rpm --skip-broken`

5. **Verify the Installation:** After the installation is complete, you can verify that Timeshift is installed correctly by running:

   `timeshift --version`

### Notes:

- **Dependencies:** The `dnf download` command should handle downloading all necessary dependencies. If there are any missing dependencies, you may need to download and install them manually.
- **Skip Broken:** The `--skip-broken` option is used to skip any packages that might cause issues during installation. This is useful in a live environment where you might not have all repositories configured correctly.
- **Permissions:** Ensure you have the necessary permissions to install packages. You might need to use `sudo` for administrative tasks.

By following these steps, you should be able to install Timeshift and its dependencies on a Fedora 40 live USB environment without updating the entire operating system.

# Option3

To install **Timeshift** and its dependencies on a Fedora 40 Live USB (Intel x86\_64) without updating the entire OS, follow these steps:

### 1. Add the Required Repository

Timeshift is typically available in the RPM Fusion repository. First, add RPM Fusion if it's not already enabled:

bash

Copy code

`sudo dnf install https://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm`

### 2. Install Timeshift

Once RPM Fusion is enabled, install Timeshift and its dependencies:

bash

Copy code

`sudo dnf install timeshift --setopt=obsoletes=0`

The `--setopt=obsoletes=0` flag ensures that DNF installs only Timeshift and its dependencies without updating other packages.

### 3. Disable Automatic Updates

To prevent system-wide updates during installation, you can temporarily disable updates by using:

bash

Copy code

`sudo dnf --disablerepo='*' --enablerepo=rpmfusion-free install timeshift`

This command will install Timeshift while disabling other repositories, so only Timeshift and its direct dependencies will be fetched.

### 4. Verify Installation

Once installed, you can verify it by running:

bash

Copy code

`timeshift --help`

This should display Timeshift's usage information, confirming that it's installed.
