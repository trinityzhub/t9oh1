In Fedora Live OS, to unlock an encrypted LUKS volume and assign a custom mapping name (alias), follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Encrypted Partition**: First, find the encrypted LUKS partition using the `lsblk` or `blkid` command.

   This will show the list of devices and partitions. Look for a partition with a `crypto_LUKS` type.

2. **Unlock the LUKS Partition with a Custom Mapping Name**: Use the `cryptsetup` command to unlock the LUKS partition and specify a custom mapping name (alias). Replace `/dev/sdXn` with the actual partition identifier.

   bash

   `sudo cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdXn my_custom_name`

   This will prompt you for the LUKS passphrase and unlock the partition, mapping it to `/dev/mapper/my_custom_name`.

3. **Mount the Unlocked Partition**: After unlocking, the LUKS container will be available under `/dev/mapper/my_custom_name`. If the encrypted volume contains an ext4 filesystem, you can mount it:

   bash

   `sudo mount /dev/mapper/my_custom_name /mnt`

   You can replace `/mnt` with any directory where you'd like to mount the filesystem.

4. **Unmount and Close the LUKS Mapping**: When you're done, unmount the partition and close the LUKS mapping:

   bash

   `sudo umount /mnt sudo cryptsetup luksClose my_custom_name`

This approach allows you to unlock and mount an encrypted LUKS partition with a custom mapping name (alias) on a Fedora Live OS.
