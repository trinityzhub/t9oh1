### Steps to Fix Internet in Chroot:

1. **Copy DNS Resolver Configuration:** Inside the live environment (before chroot), copy the DNS settings into the chroot environment:

   bash

   Copy code

- `sudo rm /mnt/etc/resolv.conf` or  `sudo mv /mnt/etc/resolv.conf /mnt/etc/resolv_backup.conf`

  `sudo cp /etc/resolv.conf /mnt/etc/resolv.conf`

  This file contains the DNS server information needed to resolve domain names like `google.com`.

2. **Enable Network Interfaces (Optional):** Sometimes, the network interfaces inside chroot are down. You can try enabling them inside the chroot:

   bash

   Copy code

   `sudo chroot /mnt dhclient`

   This will attempt to request an IP address for the network interface if needed.

3. **Verify Internet Access:** After doing the above, test internet connectivity inside the chroot:

   bash

   Copy code

   `ping google.com`

   If the ping works, you're good to go. You can now run the `dnf reinstall grub2-efi shim` command.
