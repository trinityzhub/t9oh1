## Download the RPM Files

You can use a tool like `dnf download` on a machine with internet access to download the RPM files. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Install `dnf-plugins-core`**:

   `sudo dnf install dnf-plugins-core`

2. **Download Timeshift and its dependencies**:

   `dnf download --resolve timeshift`

This command will download Timeshift and all its dependencies to the current directory.

## Install the RPM Files:

```
`sudo dnf install *.rpm`
```
